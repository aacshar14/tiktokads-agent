# Quick Workaround: Make Workflow Work NOW

## The Problem:
One or more PostgreSQL nodes have `$1`, `$2` parameters that n8n can't handle.

## âœ… Temporary Workaround:

### Option 1: Disable the Failing Nodes (Test Flow)

1. **Click on the PostgreSQL node that's failing**
2. **Turn ON "Continue On Fail"** in the node settings
3. **The workflow will skip the error and continue**
4. **You can see if the rest works**

This lets you test if your workflow structure is correct!

### Option 2: Find and Fix the Exact Node

Look at the **node connections** in n8n:

```
Webhook â†’ Get Brand ID â†’ OpenAI â†’ Process Data â†’ [FAILING NODE] â†’ ...
```

The failing node is probably:
- After "Process Data"
- Named something like "Save" or "Insert"

---

### Option 3: Use Even Simpler Queries

For ANY PostgreSQL node with errors, use these ultra-simple queries:

#### For "Save Campaign" node:
```sql
INSERT INTO campaigns (brand_id, name, objective, status) 
VALUES (1, 'Test', 'TRAFFIC', 'DRAFT') 
RETURNING id;
```

#### For "Log Generation" node:
```sql
INSERT INTO generations (brand_id, input_payload, output_payload) 
VALUES (1, '{}'::jsonb, '{}'::jsonb) 
RETURNING id;
```

**Key:** Only include the columns you need, minimum data!

### Option 4: Skip Database Nodes Temporarily

1. **Disconnect the failing PostgreSQL node**
2. **Connect a "Respond to Webhook" node after "Process Data"**
3. **Return the AI response directly**
4. **Test your endpoint**
5. **Fix database later**

---

## My Recommendation:

**Use Option 1** right now:
1. Turn on "Continue On Fail" on the failing node
2. Run the workflow
3. See if you get the AI response back
4. Then we can fix the database part

This will prove your workflow works! ðŸš€
