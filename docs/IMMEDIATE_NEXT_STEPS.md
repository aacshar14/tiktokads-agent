# Immediate Next Steps

## 1. Create "Query Campaigns" Workflow

**Purpose:** View all generated campaigns

### Workflow:
1. Manual Trigger
2. PostgreSQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.name as campaign_name,
  b.name as brand_name,
  c.objective,
  c.daily_budget,
  c.status,
  c.created_at
FROM campaigns c
JOIN brands b ON c.brand_id = b.id
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;
```

---

## 2. Create "View Campaign Details" Workflow

**Purpose:** See full campaign with all ads

### Workflow:
1. Manual Trigger (with campaign ID)
2. PostgreSQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id as campaign_id,
  c.name as campaign_name,
  b.name as brand,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ag.id) as ad_groups_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as ads_count,
  c.objective,
  c.daily_budget,
  c.status
FROM campaigns c
JOIN brands b ON c.brand_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN ad_groups ag ON c.id = ag.campaign_id
LEFT JOIN ads a ON ag.id = a.ad_group_id
WHERE c.id = 1
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, b.name, c.objective, c.daily_budget, c.status;
```

## 3. Use Current Workflow

**What it does:**
- Generates campaign with OpenAI
- Saves campaign with test data
- You get the AI-generated data in response
- Can copy/paste AI data into database manually if needed

**To use:**
1. Run workflow
2. See the AI response in "Process Data" output
3. Copy the campaign data
4. Update database manually or create update workflow

---

## 4. Build "Update Campaign" Workflow

**Purpose:** Update campaign with AI data

**Workflow:**
1. Manual Trigger (with AI response data)
2. PostgreSQL Update Query

This lets you:
- Generate with AI
- Get AI data
- Update database with AI data
- Complete automation without making main workflow complex

---

## Recommended Order:

1. âœ… Your current workflow (generating with AI)
2. Add "Query Campaigns" workflow
3. Add "Update Campaign" workflow  
4. Test complete flow
5. Enhance later

**This approach keeps things simple and working!**
