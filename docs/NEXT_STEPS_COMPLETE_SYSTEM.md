# Complete TikTok Ads Management System - Next Steps

## Current Status:
✅ Database created
✅ Brand management
✅ Campaign generation with OpenAI
✅ Basic workflow working

## What to Add Next:

### 1. Complete the Save Process
Add nodes to save all generated content:

**After "Save Campaign" node:**

#### Node: "Save Ad Groups"
- Add PostgreSQL node
- Query:
```sql
INSERT INTO ad_groups (campaign_id, name, interests, behaviors, hashtags, placements, connection)
SELECT 
  {{ $json.campaignId }},
  '{{ $json.adGroupName }}',
  '{{ $json.interests }}',
  '{{ $json.behaviors }}',
  '{{ $json.hashtags }}',
  '{{ $json.placements }}',
  '{{ $json.connection }}'
RETURNING id;
```

#### Node: "Save Individual Ads"
- Loop through ads in each ad group
- Save each ad to ads table
- Query:
```sql
INSERT INTO ads (ad_group_id, name, primary_text, cta, duration_sec, status)
VALUES (
  {{ $json.adGroupId }},
  '{{ $json.adName }}',
  '{{ $json.primaryText }}',
  '{{ $json.cta }}',
  {{ $json.durationSec }},
  'DRAFT'
)
RETURNING id;
```

---

### 2. Content Management Workflows

#### Workflow A: "List All Campaigns"
**Query campaigns with details:**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.name,
  b.name as brand_name,
  c.objective,
  c.daily_budget,
  c.status,
  COUNT(ag.id) as ad_groups_count,
  COUNT(a.id) as ads_count
FROM campaigns c
JOIN brands b ON c.brand_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN ad_groups ag ON c.id = ag.campaign_id
LEFT JOIN ads a ON ag.id = a.ad_group_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, b.name, c.objective, c.daily_budget, c.status
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;
```

#### Workflow B: "View Campaign Details"
**Get full campaign with all ads:**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.*,
  b.name as brand_name,
  ag.name as ad_group_name,
  ag.interests,
  ag.behaviors,
  ag.hashtags,
  a.name as ad_name,
  a.primary_text,
  a.cta,
  a.status as ad_status
FROM campaigns c
JOIN brands b ON c.brand_id = b.id
JOIN ad_groups ag ON c.id = ag.campaign_id
JOIN ads a ON ag.id = a.ad_group_id
WHERE c.id = $1
ORDER BY ag.id, a.id;
```

#### Workflow C: "Update Campaign Status"
**Change campaign status:**
```sql
UPDATE campaigns 
SET status = $1 
WHERE id = $2;
```

#### Workflow D: "Generate More Ads for Campaign"
- Take existing campaign
- Use OpenAI to generate variations
- Add new ad groups/ads to existing campaign

---

### 3. Advanced Features

#### A. Multi-Campaign Generation
- Generate multiple campaigns at once
- Use different objectives
- Batch processing

#### B. Content Variations
- Generate A/B test versions
- Multiple CTA options
- Different targeting

#### C. Content Library Management
- Query all ads by brand
- Search by targeting criteria
- Filter by performance

---

## Recommended Workflow Additions:

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Add Loop for Ad Groups**
   - After saving campaign, loop through ad_groups array
   - Save each ad group with campaign_id

2. **Add Loop for Ads**
   - After saving ad group, loop through ads array
   - Save each ad with ad_group_id

3. **Add Status Management**
   - Update campaign status (DRAFT → ACTIVE)
   - Track lifecycle

4. **Add Query Workflows**
   - List campaigns
   - Get campaign details
   - Filter by brand/status

---

## Template for Saving Ad Groups:

In your workflow, after "Save Campaign":

```javascript
// Process Ad Groups
const campaignId = $json.campaignId; // from previous node
const adGroups = $json.adGroups || [];

const results = [];
for (const adGroup of adGroups) {
  results.push({
    json: {
      campaignId: campaignId,
      name: adGroup.name,
      interests: adGroup.interests,
      behaviors: adGroup.behaviors,
      hashtags: adGroup.hashtags,
      placements: adGroup.placements,
      connection: adGroup.connection
    }
  });
}

return results;
```

Then use these values in "Save Ad Groups" PostgreSQL node.

---

## Content Management Queries:

### Get All Campaigns:
```sql
SELECT * FROM campaigns 
WHERE brand_id = $1 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Get Full Campaign Structure:
```sql
WITH campaign_data AS (
  SELECT c.*, b.name as brand_name
  FROM campaigns c
  JOIN brands b ON c.brand_id = b.id
  WHERE c.id = $1
)
SELECT 
  cd.*,
  json_agg(
    json_build_object(
      'ad_group', ag.name,
      'ads', (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(a)) FROM ads a WHERE a.ad_group_id = ag.id)
    )
  ) as ad_groups
FROM campaign_data cd
LEFT JOIN ad_groups ag ON cd.id = ag.campaign_id
GROUP BY cd.id;
```

## Complete Content Management System:

You'll need these workflows:

1. **Generate Campaign** (you have this) ✅
2. **List Campaigns** (query all campaigns)
3. **View Campaign** (get full details)
4. **Update Status** (activate/archive campaigns)
5. **Generate Variations** (create A/B test versions)
6. **Content Library** (browse all ads by brand)
7. **Performance Tracking** (add metrics table later)

---

## Your Action Plan:

### Step 1: Complete Current Workflow
Add nodes to save ad groups and ads after campaign

### Step 2: Create Management Workflows
Query and manage your campaigns

### Step 3: Add Enhancements
Status updates, variations, content library

Would you like me to create these additional workflow files for you?
