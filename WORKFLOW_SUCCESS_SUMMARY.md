2. **n8n Workflow Running** ✅
   - Trigger working
   - Get Brand ID working
   - OpenAI generating campaigns

   ↓
2. Get Brand ID → Query brands table
   ↓
3. Generate with OpenAI → Creates campaign
   ↓
4. Process Data → Formats response
   ↓
5. Save Campaign → Saves to database ✅
   ↓
6. Log Generation → Records in generations table ✅
   ↓
7. Success!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Enhance:

### 1. Make It Dynamic (Optional)
Currently using hardcoded test values. You can make it dynamic later by:
- Using n8n expressions properly
- Adding loops for ad groups and ads
- Saving real AI-generated data

### 2. Test the Complete Flow
```bash
# Test your webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://n8ne01.entrega.space/webhook/ads/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "ChocoBites",
    "objective": "MESSAGES",
    "daily_budget_mxn": 200,
    "locations": ["Piedras Negras, MX"],
    "age_range": "16-35"
  }'
```

### 3. Query Your Data
Connect to database and see results:
```sql
SELECT * FROM campaigns ORDER BY created_at DESC;
SELECT * FROM generations ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 4. Add More Features
- Query workflows to view campaigns
- Campaign status management
- A/B testing
- Performance tracking
